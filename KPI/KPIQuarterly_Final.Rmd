### FY19 Quarterly KPI


```{r fig.height=11, fig.width=8}
FMQ19$Inquiries <- c(63, 150, 369, 395)

### FY18 Quarterly KPI

## Conclusions:

* It is difficult to speculate as to how Covid-19 may have impacted  performance, nevertheless, it is important to note that the social distancing due to the global pandemic became mandatory for the entire third month of the quarter. Digital and social media platforms remain a primary means of staying connected.

* FY20 Q3 KPI continued to be strong. The overall CTR, is the highest we have seen in the past three years.

* The average time on page, 1:40, is steady.

* Unique page views are way up from last quarter and are at a three year high, more than double from last quarter. This jump is largely due to Snapchat traffic.

* The overall bounce rate is higher than that of Q2, however, this is in part due to Snapchat as well. 

* The overall number of inquiries is \textcolor{red}{down}, to about half those from FY19Q3; however, they are double from FY18Q3 and up from FY20Q2. I will continue to monitor this performance indicator.
